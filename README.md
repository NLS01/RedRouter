# RedRouter
A general router for speedrunning Pokemon Red

## About
Inspired by DailyLeaf's RedHelper, and the wish for having something even more general, i.e. helpers for yellow, other%, ...

## Building
Tested with NetBeans

## How to use
### DV Calculator
- Select the game, this used for filtering out possible DVs
- Select your pokemon
- Select the starting level of your pokemon
- Select where your pokemon was caught, this is used for filtering out possible DVs based on encounter rate
- Click on a button with the corresponding stat you see
- If you're 100% certain of a specific DV, just hold CTRL + click the DV
- Add the pokemon that were defeated before getting the current level
- If you switched out during battle and the other pokemon still lives, check the "shared" box (for now this only works if there is only 1 other pokemon that entered the battle (that still lives), since this is mostly the case)

## Plans for the future
- Include DSUM generater (Yellow opt.)
- Work on the router part
